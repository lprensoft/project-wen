# Configuration and models

## The config file

See [config.example.yaml](../../config.example.yaml). The essentials:

| Option | Description |
|---|---|
| `model.provider` / `model.name` | The provider and model id to start with (the settings page's "Models" section takes over from here; see below) |
| `model.thinking` | Thinking effort: `off` / `low` / `medium` / `high` / `xhigh` / `max`, `high` by default (`temperature` has no effect while thinking is on; the reasoning is shown as a collapsible block in the web UI) |
| `model.context_length` | The model's context window in tokens, 1000000 by default. Over budget, whole turns are trimmed starting from the oldest; once measured usage reaches 90% of it, the session is compacted into a summary |
| `server.trust_loopback` | Whether requests from loopback skip authentication, on by default. It **must** be turned off behind a reverse proxy (see [Deployment and access control](deployment.md)) |
| `providers.<name>` | The provider registry: `type` (`openai_compat` / `anthropic`), `base_url`, `api_key` |
| `agent.system_prompt` | The system prompt (empty by default; at runtime a `[system environment]` block — OS, shell, working directory, locale — is injected in front of it) |
| `agent.max_turns` | The cap on tool-loop iterations within one request |
| `agent.workdir` | The working directory shared by the plugins and the environment block; empty means the process's current directory |
| `session.dir` | Where sessions are stored, `<config dir>/sessions` by default |

**Plugin toggles and settings are not in config.yaml.** They are maintained from the settings page and stored only in `<config dir>/plugins.state.json`. On a first run every plugin is enabled with the defaults it declares, except for these twenty-one: `roleplay` and `dual_persona` (without a character sheet and trigger phrases they are not a feature at all); `scene`, `belongings`, `body_sense`, `health`, `mood`, `people`, `agenda`, `relationship`, `unspoken`, `presence` and `style_watch` (they work fine out of the box and are off only because they hard-depend on `roleplay`, which is off); `weather` (it depends on `roleplay` and needs a city before it can fetch anything); `skills` (the skills directory is empty, so all it adds is two tools with nothing to do); `heartbeat` (something that burns quota unattended should be an explicit choice); and `qq_bot`, `wechat_bot`, `feishu_bot`, `lark_bot` and `telegram_bot` (they need credentials, or a code scanned, before they can do anything). Each plugin's own data lives in `<config dir>/plugins/<plugin>/`.

(Early versions accepted a `plugins:` section in config.yaml. When something can be configured in two places, you have to remember a precedence rule to know which one is in effect — and since the settings page never writes back to the config file, what is written there slowly turns into a lie. That section no longer has any effect; the program says so once at start-up, and you can delete it.)

## Models (settings page → Models)

Providers and models can be added, edited and removed on the settings page, and the combination in use switched there, with **the next request** picking up the change — no restart.

- Changes are written to `<config dir>/models.json` (mode 0600, already in `.gitignore`) and **never back to config.yaml** — `${VAR}` in an `api_key` is expanded before parsing, so writing back would freeze the plaintext key into the file and lose every comment.
- The `providers:` and `model:` sections of config.yaml are initial values: an entry of the same name is fully overridden by models.json, while a provider **newly added** to config.yaml still shows up in the list (marked "from the config file"). Deleting it in the UI records a tombstone, so it does not come back after a restart; an entry you have never touched in the UI is not written to models.json at all and keeps following the config file.
- Each model entry can override `context_length` / `max_tokens` / `thinking` / `temperature` on its own; left empty, the global values from the `model:` section apply.
- **Note**: once a key that came from `${VAR}` has been written into models.json it is fixed there, and changing the environment variable afterwards has no effect.

Two API modes are supported:

| Mode | Description |
|---|---|
| `openai_compat` | The OpenAI-compatible protocol (DeepSeek and others) |
| `anthropic` | The Anthropic Messages API. Thinking effort maps to `thinking:{type:"adaptive"}` plus `output_config.effort` (`off` becomes `disabled`); current-generation Claude models do not accept sampling parameters, so `temperature` is not sent and that field of a model entry has no effect here |

Anthropic mode has one extra switch: **prompt caching** (on by default). With it on, the unchanging parts of a request (tools, system, the history so far) are marked cacheable, and whatever hits the cache is billed at roughly a tenth of the price. The cost is that a miss pays about a quarter extra for the write, and the cache only lives a few minutes — if your conversation moves more slowly than that (chatting on and off through an IM channel, say), turning it off is cheaper. OpenAI-compatible mode has no such switch: caching at DeepSeek and OpenAI is maintained server-side, and whether you hit it depends only on how stable your request prefix is (see [How the context is organized](context.md)).
